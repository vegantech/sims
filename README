SIMS- open source
Track Student Interventions

see deployment for information on how to deploy.    This will be centrally hosted, but you're welcome to set up your own instance and help contribute code.


Note: There are some required gems for testing.  To see them set the RAILS_ENV to test:
rake  gems RAILS_ENV=test


Be sure to set the domain name of the SIMS application in the config/initializers/host_info.rb file to send the proper links in emails generated by the application.

    <h1>SIMS District Upload API</h1>
    <p> Each file when uploaded will overwrite the current content in the district.
    For example, if you create a students.csv with just first graders,
    then upload another one with just second graders, SIMS will only have the second graders in the system.
    Combine all your students into a single file.
    </p>

    <p> Each file has one or more references to district keys in the form district_table_id. These must be: <ul>
      <li>unique- each should represent exactly one record</li>
      <li>persistent- they should remain the same over time, even over years.</li>
      <li>consistent- it must be the same number even when used in different files.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> The files must match the specified format.
    Headers must be in the order listed and all must be present.   If you're not using a column then leave it blank (with nothing between the ","'s or with NULL between them.)
    </p>

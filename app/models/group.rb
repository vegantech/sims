class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
  DESCRIPTION="
  This feature allows administrators to set up and edit groups that are used to assign students to staff.
  The most common group is sections of classes which are assigned by the school administrator or uploaded by the local systems administrator.
  The other common group is a group of students that have the same interventions and progress monitors
  which allows staff to enter progress monitoring data for all the students in the group on one screen."

need way for sims to import from districts
   students
   system flags (or data to create them)
   student groupings


need way for sims to export
   ??? 
   Wisconsin Longitudinal System???
   Other student information systems


first round
csv bulk update (all at once)
csv required fields, any order


goals.   be able to import

student- , firstname, lastname, id_state or id_district  id_state needed for interdistrict xfer  DOB, ESL, special_ed


enrollment grade, school (id_district or id_state), student (id_district or id_state)
flags


1. upload students.csv
process students.csv          edit existing records if there are changes, add new ones, delete (unset district) remainder


2. upload file.zip containing students.csv
process students.csv

3. process file.zip asynchronously,  don't tie up browser session

4. process upload of file.zip asynchronously

5. add enrollments.csv to zip

6. add extended_profiles.zip





A district admin should be able to
upload a zip file containing students.csv  password zip file?



give  each district them ssh cert, user?
job scp's zip file district.zip to home directory    
poll filesystem and look for changes,   or some other scp hook
give ssh key or cert for unattendended xfer
encryption, unattended, asynchronous
email if problems

neg
pain to setup and maintain,  needs vendor buyin (potentially)











   


processing large files
ideas

could be offloaded to another server
look at field order in csv
get another csv from db in same order
sort original csv in same order as db server
do diff
handle insertions, deletions and updates from diff file


--------------- File formats
students.csv   id_state, id_district, first_name, last_name, [middle_name], [suffix], birthdate, number


enrollments.csv student_id_state, school_id_state, grade, [year]


notes
[middle_name] [suffix] not currently in SIMS, will probably need to be added.


---------

students-   add suffix, and middlename (and just fullname methods)
users- add suffix, and middlename (and just fullname methods)
Shawn A Balestracci Jr
Balestracci, Shawn A., Jr.

school- id_state, id_district, name
enrollments- student_id_state, student_id_district, school_id_state, school_id_district, grade, endyear  (add endyear)


user- add suffix, middlename....   
id_district, first_name, last_name, middle, suffix, passwordhash, salt, email (booleans for "district_admin", "school_admin", "district_builder", "regular_user", "news_admin")



district- add key and next_key (which takes effect when users are uploaded)
passwordhash- Sha1.hex(shared_key + district_key + data + salt)


Flag(id: integer, category: string, user_id: integer, district_id: integer, student_id: integer, reason: text, type: string, created_at: datetime, updated_at: datetime)
(wipe existing system flags, then just import new)

flag- category[ one of {attendance languagearts math suspension}], student_id_district,student_id_state, reason_text

extended_profile named id_district.xpr    (one for each student, zipped up) suggest directory structure if there are going to be over 9999 files in directory



in builder, offer template for extended profile,   set of pre tags initially

extended_profile,  they can generate their own file, or they do extended_profile.csv  for freetext,   we can eventually add addresses.   

extended_extra.csv
id_student,html_blob
1,"<pre>This is the best student evah, I cannot use enough commas to,
fully, describe, how, great, they're.</pre><blink>
""This"", is blinking.
</blink>
"

flags (system)
extended profiles


group title, school_id_district or school_id_state [add group_id_district]   school cannot be nil


District 12
course_id, name
1, Proctology 101

neigbhorhood_id, name
1, Mr. Rogers

Groups
1, Proctology 101
1, Mr. Rogers

student_id, course_id, school_id
007, course-1,  school1
008, neighborhood-1,  school2

District 27
course_id, name
1, French Literature



district_group_id will probably be table-pk

students_groups
student_id_district, student_id_state, district_group_id_with_table

user_groups
user_id_district, district_group_id_with_table, is_principal_boolean


special_user_groups remove_integer
For users with access to all student in district

all_students_in_district.csv
user_id_district, is_principal (if they're the princpal for everyone.), grade (probably don't need.)

all_students_in_school.csv
user_id_district, school_id_district, is_principal, grade
is_principal if user is the principal for that group,   grade if limited to a certain grade


user_schools
school_id_district, user_id_district, admin(boolean)
Admin means they can create/delete groups, or the school quicklist.  Most likely a school secretary
